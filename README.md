# Perfect Pipeline Workshop

Welcome to the "Perfect Pipeline" workshop! This hands-on workshop teaches you how to build a comprehensive security-focused CI/CD pipeline with multiple layers of security scanning and best practices.

## üèóÔ∏è Workshop Structure

The workshop is organized into different modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of pipeline security:

### üìÅ Repository Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/               # GitHub Actions workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code/                            # Sample vulnerable application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infra/                           # Terraform infrastructure
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workshop/                        # Workshop modules and documentation
```

## üìö Workshop Modules

### 0. üê¶‚Äçüî• [Introduction](workshop/)
Workshop introduction.

### 1. üîç [Pipeline Security Scan](workshop/pipeline_scan/)
Learn to scan CI/CD pipelines for security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

### 2. üî¨ [Code Security Analysis](workshop/code_scan/)
Implement SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and SCA (Software Composition Analysis).

### 3. üîê [Secrets Scan](workshop/secrets_scan/)
Detect and prevent exposure of credentials and sensitive information.

### 4. üê≥ [Container Security Scanning](workshop/container_scan/)
Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

### 5. üèóÔ∏è [Infrastructure Security Scan](workshop/iac_scan/)
Analyze Infrastructure as Code for security issues.

### 6. üîç [Runtime Infrastructure Scan](workshop/runtime_infra_scan/)
Scan the "real" infrastructure for vulnerabilities.

### 7. ü§ñ [AI Security Analysis](workshop/ai_scan/)
Leverage artificial intelligence for comprehensive security reviews and intelligent vulnerability detection.


## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GitHub Account to fork the repository
- Basic knowledge of CI/CD concepts
- Familiarity with containers and cloud infrastructure concepts

> [!TIP]
> While this workshop uses GitHub Actions, most of the skills and best practices you learn can be applied to any CI/CD platform.

### Workshop Flow
1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Follow each module** in the workshop directory
3. **Run the workflows** and observe the security findings
4. **Learn to fix** the identified vulnerabilities
5. **Implement security best practices**

### Workshop Goal
The idea of this workshop is to demonstrate how to build a "perfect" (secure and practical) CI/CD pipeline using open-source tools (OSS).

**The goal is inspirational, not prescriptive.** We do not want you to copy these examples, but to understand the principles and identify the modular components you can adapt to implement in your own environment.

### üéì Learning Outcomes

By completing this workshop, you will:
- Understand the importance of shift-left security
- Learn the key stages of a secure pipeline:
  - Pipeline Security
  - Static and Dynamic Code Analysis
  - Secrets Detection
  - Container Security
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security
  - Runtime Infrastructure Security
- Know relevant OSS tools for each stage
- Grasp the principles needed to start building or improving your own secure CI/CD process

### Out of Scope (What this workshop is NOT)
- Deep dives into specific development workflows (e.g., Gitflow vs. Trunk-based)
- Focus on a specific application technology stack (language/framework agnostic where possible)
- A definitive statement on the "best" tools (alternatives will be mentioned for key steps)
