# Runtime Infrastructure Scan

This workshop module focuses on scanning the deployed (runtime) infrastructure for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that may not be detectable through static analysis of code or configuration files.

## Why is Runtime Infrastructure Scanning Important?

While IaC scans catch many issues pre-deployment, runtime infrastructure scanning is crucial because some vulnerabilities or misconfigurations only manifest once resources are live. This could be due to manual changes, dynamic variables, complex interactions, or even a bug in your IaC provider that end up deploying resources in a way that is not intended.

Continuous runtime scanning helps ensure your infrastructure remains secure after deployment and as it evolves.


## Common Runtime Infrastructure Issues

- **Misconfigurations** - Public exposed resources, weak IAM policies, unrestricted security groups
- **IAM vulnerabilities** - Credential theft, privilege escalation, brute force attacks
- **Insecure APIs and Interfaces** - API key leaks, MITM attacks, rate-limiting bypass
- **Data Breaches and Exfiltration** - Unencrypted data exposure, insider threats, SQL injection attacks.
- **Inadequate Monitoring and Logging** - Log tampering, cryptojacking, lack of real-time alerts

## Tools Used in This Module

- **Prowler** – Perform security best practices assessments for multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, M365, GitHub and more).
  - It can be used also for continuous monitoring and remediation, but we will focus on the assessment part.
- **Steampipe** – SQL-based infrastructure analysis and compliance checking for cloud platforms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the importance of runtime infrastructure scanning
- Learn to use automated tools to assess live cloud environments
